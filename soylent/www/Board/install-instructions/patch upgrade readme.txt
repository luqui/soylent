Patch readme.

if your reading this, that means you have some version of 1.0 if your still running .5 or .9 refer yourself to the upgrade readme.

to update yourself to the current release, just upload the updated files listed in the 1.0.x fixes.txt files.

these files will explain what's fixed and how to apply it.

Do NOT run install.php! you'll only get errors if you do, just upload the new/updated files.

of course, don't upload any of the readme files.

If you need any further assistance, please contact me.

Thank you.
