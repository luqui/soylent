The goal is to create a system with simple-minded, but semi-realistic
social AI simulation.

There is a set of characters C.

A _world model_ A assigns to each character:
    * A set of _resources_        R
    * A weighted set of _desires_ D
    * A world model               W
    * A _location_                L

With an idempotence property:

    A(c).W = A(c).W(c).W

That is, in c's world model in c's world model is just c's world model
(you know that you know everything you know).

An _action_ is a function from world models to world models.  The following
are actions:
    * Resource transformation r, satisfying the the following laws:
        if r(W) = W' then
            * W(c).L /= W(d).L => W(c) = W(d)
            * W(c).D = W(d).d

An action is _silly_ iff the result of the action is complicated.
