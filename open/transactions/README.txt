Running the game:
  Run telegnosis and answer the questions it asks you.  Every question has
  a reasonable default if you just push enter.  Soylent Software has a game
  server, so you don't have to run one.

Input:
  Wait for your turn (the "Your Turn" indicator shows up in the lower left of the
  screen), and then click on one of your pieces followed by an adjacent destination.

  Spacebar - end your turn, adding the move to your transaction.
  Enter    - end your turn, committing your transaction and sharing it with the other players.
  x        - cancel your transaction.
  Escape   - quit the game.

Rules:
  The object of the game is to destroy all enemies.  To destroy an enemy, either reduce
  him to one unit or destroy all of his foxholes.

  Each time you move, you add the move to your personal transaction (series of moves),
  which your opponents cannot see.  When you push enter, you share your moves with the
  other players and make them final.  If an opponent shares moves which interfere
  with your current transaction before you do, all the moves in your current transaction
  are aborted, and your pieces are placed back into the place where you last committed.

  Filled-in colored circles are your units, which you move.  Colored circle outlines
  are foxholes, which you cannot move, but serve a strategic purpose.  

  To destroy an enemy unit or foxhole, move to its location.   However, you must have more "support"
  than the opponent in order to take it.  Your support is the number of units you have adjacent
  to the target.  The opponent's support is the number of units he has adjacent to the
  unit that is being attacked.  Foxholes which have a unit inside count that unit toward
  its support.  If a foxhole with a unit inside is taken, then both the foxhole and the
  unit are destroyed.
