I think three military unit types will be in the game:  Cavalry, Swordsmen,
and Pikemen.  Following is the fighting table.  It is expressed as one of
the letters W,S,E (Weak,Strong,Equal) of the thing on the left against the
thing on the top. 

      |  C  |  S  |  P  |
    --+-----+-----+-----+
    C |  E  |  S  |  W  |
    S |  W  |  E  |  S  |
    P |  S  |  W  |  E  |

For example, a pikeman is strong against a cavalry (third row, first column).
E = 50%, S > 50%, W = 100% - S  (eg., 50%, 85%, and 15%).

Each unit has a set of abilities different from the others, too:

    Cavalry move 5x as fast as swordsmen and pikemen, but cannot travel
        through forest.
    Pikemen are stronger in numbers.
    Swordsmen are equally strong on all sides (there is no advantage to
        attacking them from behind).

Units can gain experience, which makes them stronger in battle.  The difference
in experience skews the probabilities toward asymptotes.  The asymptotes for
a particular matchup in the table above are:

    W --> E
    E --> S
    S --> 100%

For example, a very strong swordsman will still never be 50% against a
first-level cavalry, but it can get arbitrarily close.  Also, a very strong
pikeman can never get above S (eg. 85%) against another pikemen, no matter how
strong.  This means that proper unit choice is a strong defense, and experience
can only skew the primary result.

Units can gain experience either by killing enemy units (one experience per
kill) or by training more (which costs $$$).  An experience 2 unit costs twice
as much as the experience 1 unit of the same type (and takes twice as long to
train), and so on.  The idea is that it is expensive to pay for experience, so
letting units gain it in battle is often a better way to go, but not the only
way to go.

You have a fixed population to work with, divided up into your work force and
your army.  The more work force you have, the faster and better armor weapons,
and boats are made.  But if you need more soldiers, you need to draw from your
work force.  If you need more work force, you need to trim down your army.  If
a bunch of people get slaughtered by the enemy, it might be worthwhile to give
surrender.

Units don't have health bars.  If you get your arm sliced off in battle, it
is doubtful that you'd still be able to fight.  However, we could allow the
concept of a wounded unit that you can take back to the hospital and prepare
for working or battle again.
